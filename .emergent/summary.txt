<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully brought a sophisticated Telegram bot from concept to a feature-rich application. The development was highly iterative, driven by direct user feedback for debugging and feature expansion. Initial challenges included webhook configuration, OpenAI API key management, and ensuring correct group chat interactions. Core architectural decisions involved moving from a React+FastAPI stack to a pure FastAPI backend for the Telegram bot. The engineer systematically addressed critical issues such as image processing (shifting to Base64 encoding for reliability), refining AI prompts for data extraction, managing conversation context, implementing role-based access control, and adding complex features like topic-specific settings, dynamic data storage, and Excel export, all while continuously debugging and refining existing functionalities.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a private Telegram bot for family use, integrating with ChatGPT and other OpenAI models. The bot's core functionalities include:
1.  **Food Image Analysis**: Automatic recognition of food items, extracting dish names, calories, and macronutrients (BJU), with data storage and daily/weekly/monthly summaries.
2.  **Database Query via AI**: AI-powered retrieval of food data based on natural language queries, active only on commands/mentions.
3.  **User Health Profiles**: Storage of user-specific health data (height, weight, etc.) with custom fields and historical tracking.
4.  **Fitness Partner AI**: Dedicated AI for personalized fitness advice, incorporating user's food consumption and activity data.
5.  **Free Chat AI**: General AI interaction, including image generation (DALL-E) and document/voice/video analysis, with model selection.
6.  **Contextual Conversations**: Bot maintains context in private chats until explicitly stopped, and in group topics with auto-summarization after 50 messages.
7.  **Role-Based Access**: Restrict bot interaction to authorized users (@Dimidiy as admin, @MariaPaperman as user); admin can manage user roles and access.
8.  **Topic-Specific Functionality in Groups**: Each topic can have custom AI prompts, data storage (e.g., movies, books), and configurable auto-deletion times for bot messages.
9.  **Administrative Panel**: An  command (for admin only) to manage users, groups, topic settings, and export data.
10. **Data Export**: Ability to export user and topic data to XLS format for administrators.
11. **Enhanced User Data**: Track daily steps and weekly workouts with historical data for personalized fitness advice.

<pending_tasks>
The previous AI engineer declared ПОЛНАЯ РЕАЛИЗАЦИЯ ТЗ ЗАВЕРШЕНА! (Full implementation of the task is complete!) in Message 417. However, subsequent user feedback revealed several issues that the AI engineer began addressing:
-   Fixing persistent issues with  and  handling in statistics queries.
-   Correcting an issue where the topic prompt was not saving or being correctly used, especially in group contexts.
-   Debugging why the bot was not reacting to @mentions consistently in group chats.
The last action was removing a duplicate state handler in  related to .
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in debugging and fixing critical issues reported by the user after the supposed full implementation of the bot. The user reported that the bot had stopped responding intermittently, provided empty nutrition statistics, and that the topic prompt was not saving correctly.

The current work focuses on resolving three main issues:
1.  **Statistics Functionality Fixes**: Addressing errors related to  and  handling in the  command. The AI engineer identified that  was being passed as a string instead of an integer and that some callback handlers for statistics (e.g., , ) were missing. Code was added to correctly handle these.
2.  **Topic Prompt Saving and Context Issue**: Investigating why the custom prompt for a topic was not being saved or applied. The engineer discovered that the  processing, which is critical for multi-step dialogues like setting a topic prompt, was incorrectly placed and only active for private chats. The fix involved relocating the state handling logic in  to ensure it applies consistently across both private and group chats, and removing a duplicate state handler for .
3.  **Bot Reaction to @Mentions**: This issue is intertwined with the state handling and group message processing. Ensuring the bot correctly interprets and responds to mentions, especially in the context of natural language queries, is part of the ongoing fix for group interaction.

The most recent action was modifying  to remove a duplicate section of code responsible for handling the  user state, indicating the engineer is streamlining the state management logic.

<optional_next_step>
Re-test the topic prompt saving, @mention reactions, and enhanced statistics functionality to confirm that the recent fixes have resolved the reported issues.
